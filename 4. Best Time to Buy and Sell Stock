#To find the max profit we can get, we will try to get the min price we
# have seen so far and use todays price as the selling price. 
# When we do todaysPrice-minPriceTillNow we will get the best deal for 
# today. To find the best deal for all the days, we will use:
# maxProfit = max(maxProfit, todaysPrice-minPriceTillNow)
# This will maximize the profit. 

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        minPriceTillNow = prices[0]
        maxProfit = 0
        for todaysPrice in prices:
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, todaysPrice-minPriceTillNow)
            minPriceTillNow = min(minPriceTillNow, todaysPrice)
        return maxProfit
